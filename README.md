# Waterlevel-ImageProcessing
Image processing software to determine water depth of a river or at a harbour

This Python file takes an image of a river, and find the distance between a refernce line, and the waterline.

It will require some altering based on the set up, and the site conditions. 

An example photo has been uploaded that works with the current set up.
